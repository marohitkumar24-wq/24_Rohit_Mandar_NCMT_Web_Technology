LONG QUESTION ANSWER

Q1.”Planning is the most critical phase of web development.” Discuss this statement by listing the key activities performed during the planning phase.
Ans: Planning is the most important step in web development because it sets the foundation for the whole project. If planning is done properly, the website can be built efficiently and with fewer problems.

Key activities during the planning phase:

1.Defining goals: Deciding what the website should achieve, like providing information, selling products, or promoting services.
2.Understanding the target audience: Knowing who will use the website and what they expect.
3.Creating a site map: Organizing the website’s pages and showing how they are connected.
4.Choosing technology and tools: Selecting the right programming languages, frameworks, and platforms.
5.Resource planning: Estimating time, budget, and the people needed to complete the project.

Activities in maintenance:

1.Bug fixing: Correcting errors or problems that appear after the website goes live.
2.Content updates: Adding new information, images, or features to keep the site relevant.
3.Performance monitoring: Checking website speed, security, and user experience regularly.

Why a website is never truly finished:

Users’ needs and expectations evolve over time.
Continuous improvement is necessary to keep the website functional, secure, and attractive.

SCENERIO BASED QUESTIOIN.

Q1. You are the project manager for a new e-commerce site. The client wants to skip the ”Testing” phase to save money and launch early. Write a persuasive argument explaining the potential risks (security, functionality, compatibility) of skipping this phase.
Ans: Scenario: Client wants to skip the Testing phase.

Persuasive argument:

Skipping the testing phase to save time or money is very risky for an e-commerce website. Testing is important to make sure the site works properly for all users and devices.

1.Security risks: Without testing, the website may have vulnerabilities that hackers can exploit, putting customer data, payments, and personal information at risk.
2.Functionality issues: Buttons, forms, or the checkout system might not work correctly. This can frustrate users and make them leave the site.
3.Compatibility problems: The website may not display or function properly on all browsers or devices, such as phones, tablets, or different browsers.

Skipping testing can save money in the short term, but it may cause loss of customers, reputation, and even legal problems later. Testing ensures the website is safe, reliable, and user-friendly before launch.

Q2.A developer begins coding a website immediately after meeting the client, without creating a design prototype or sitemap. Midway through, the client rejects the layout. Analyze what went wrong in the process and how it should have been handled.
Ans: In this case, the main problem is that the developer skipped the planning and design phases. By starting coding immediately, there was no clear structure, no site map, and no prototype for the client to review. As a result, the layout didn’t match the client’s expectations, leading to rejection midway.

What went wrong:

No planning or site map: The pages and navigation weren’t properly organized.

No design prototype: The client could not visualize the website before development.

Wasted time and effort: Coding had to be redone after the client rejected the layout.

How it should have been handled:

First, gather information and understand the client’s requirements.

Create a site map showing all pages and their hierarchy.

Design a prototype or wireframe to give the client a clear idea of the layout and features.

Get client approval before starting coding.
